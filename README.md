## Functional Requirements written as User stories ##

User story, Wikipedia definition:\
_"In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in specific management software."_

In theory, we could obtain this information from a "hypothetical" client.

_"We gather user stories through various user research methods such as interviews, questionnaires, observations, and others."_ - Chisel Labs
